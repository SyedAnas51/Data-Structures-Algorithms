# Data-Structures-Algorithms

Welcome to my repository of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations! This collection includes a range of foundational data structures and algorithms, all implemented in C++ as part of my semester course at the university. Each implementation is designed to showcase key concepts and practical applications, providing insights into how these structures operate and their utility in various scenarios.

# Contents
Heaps: Implementations of heap data structures, including binary heaps.
AVL Trees: Balanced binary search trees with automatic rebalancing.
Linked Lists:
Singly Linked Lists
Doubly Linked Lists
Binary Search Trees (BST): Standard binary search trees with essential operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Binary Trees: Basic implementations and operations for binary trees.
Hash Tables: Implementations featuring rehashing and collision handling techniques.
Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure implementations.
Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure implementations.

# Features

Insertion and Deletion: Efficient methods for managing and modifying data within various structures.
Traversal Algorithms: Includes in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal for trees, along with other traversal techniques.
Heap Operations: Functions for inserting, deleting, and heapifying elements.
Hashing Techniques: Operations for inserting, deleting, and searching in hash tables with support for rehashing.
Linked List Operations: Core operations for singly and doubly linked lists including insertion, deletion, and traversal.


NOTE: Some of the code may not run, it may be because of runtime error or the data stored in the memory may be too large (in bytes). Remember these codes are basic foundations of the DSA, you just have to remember the idea of the specific topics.


# Usage

To use the code in this repository:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SyedAnas51/Data-Structures-Algorithms.git

Navigate to the desired directory:

cd Data-Structures-Algorithms

Compile the C++ files using a compiler like g++:

g++ filename.cpp -o outputname

Run the compiled executable:

./outputname


OR

You can just simply download the zip file and help yourself with the code file you want to preview.
